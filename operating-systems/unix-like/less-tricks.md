# `less` Tricks

Some tricks about `less` command:

* `/<text>`: forward search text;
* `?<text>`: backward search text;
* `n`: next match;
* `N`: previous match;
* `G`: go to the end of the content;
* `g`: go to the start of the content;
* `F`: show the newly appended content dynamically (same as `tail -f`);
