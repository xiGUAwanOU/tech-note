# Configure Keyboard Shortcuts

There are several places where one could configure the keyboard shortcuts:

1. `Startmenu --> Settings --> Keyboard --> Application Shortcuts`
2. `Startmenu --> Settings --> Window Manager --> Keyboard`
3. `Startmenu --> Settings --> Settings Editor --> xfce4-keyboard-shortcuts`
