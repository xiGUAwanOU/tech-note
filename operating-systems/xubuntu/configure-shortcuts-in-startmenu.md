# Configure the Shortcuts in Startmenu

Xfce will search following paths to find `*.desktop` files as the shortcuts in startmenu:

```text
    ~/.local/share/applications/
    /etc/xdg/xubuntu/applications/
    /usr/share/applications/
    /usr/share/gnome/apps/
    /home/user/.kde/share/
    /usr/share/applnk/ 
```
