# CSS: Display Attribute
* `display: block`:
  * takes up the full width of its parent by default (expanded);
  * begins and ends with newlines;
  * dimension is characterised by `width`, `height`, `padding`, `border` and `margin`.
* `display: inline`:
  * takes the width of its content by default (shrinked to fit);
  * begins and ends with no newlines;
  * dimension is characterised by `padding`, `border` and `margin`, not `width` or `height`;
  * `line-height` will adjust its height;
  * `margin` only works for left and right sides.
* `display: inline block`:
  * takes the width of its content by default (shrinked to fit);
  * begins and ends with no newlines;
  * dimension is characterised by `width`, `height`, `padding`, `border` and `margin`;
  * legacy value is `inline-block`.
