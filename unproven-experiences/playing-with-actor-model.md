# Playing with Actor Model
Some na√Øve throughts about actor model.

## Application
By definition, [actor model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) is a mathmatical model of concurrent computation. This indicates that, it does not fit well into the sequential situations, because of the actor model has inconsistency issues.

## Sending Logic as Message
Ideally, an actor can only communicate with other actors by sending messages. If an actor wants to affect the other actors, it will rely on the other actors to apply the effects by themselves. This is not intuitive, for example, if I've pushed somebody else, it's not the pushed person wants to step back, but only because he is pushed. So if we put the step back logic in the pushed person, which will be a little bit strange.

To overcome this, simply define actions as a special message type, which could contains the logic of the action. Once received the action message, the receiver should apply the logic on itself. In this case, the action logic will not be implemented by the target of the action.

But notice that, since in this case, message delivering and handling for a single actor could be performed on different physical threads, remember to add locks per actor to avoid potential conflictions.

## Ideas of Implementation
Usually the number of actors is far more bigger than the number of calculating units (CPU cores for example). A way to map a larger number of actors to a smaller number of calculating units is letting calculating units fetch jobs from a job pool, where a job is a chuck of calculating load of one single actor.

This can be probably applied on video games. Each job can be the frame update for a single game object (actor). In this case, the load of the frame update is distributed onto different CPU cores.

## Possible Limitations
Inconsistency is the core problem in the actor model.

Another problem that I can think of is, if not designed properly, there can easily be scalability problems. Especially the "logically centralized information holder". For example, if an actor wants to know which actor can be an eligible target for its next message, it could query some centralized database for this information. However this will immediately introduce potential scalability problem on the centralized database. This pattern also applies to global messaging queue, an actor receiving a lot of events, etc..

But there are a lot of different solutions for the previously mentioned problems out there. So generally speaking, I don't think scalability is the core problem of actor model.
