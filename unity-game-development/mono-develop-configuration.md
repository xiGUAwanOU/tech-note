# Mono Develop Configuration

This is only personal preferences. Don't follow them unless you have the same taste as I do.

Things that need to be configured:

1. Go to `Preferences -> Source Code`, make the styles of `C# source code` and `Text file` to `Microsoft Visual Studio`, and `XML document` to `Mono`;
2. Go to `Preferences -> Text Editor -> Source Analysis`, tick `Enable source analysis of open files` and `Enable text editor unit test integration`.
