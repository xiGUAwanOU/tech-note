# Setup Development Environment

On Ubuntu, `rvm` is preferred. On MacOS, `brew` might be a good choice, but not totally sure about that. Read the official documents about these two tools.

If using `rvm` to install Ruby, `gem` should also be installed. However, still need to install `bundler`. In Ubuntu using:

```shell
$ gem install bundler
```

Some useful plugins for Atom:
* linter
* linter-rubocop
* rubocop-auto-correct
