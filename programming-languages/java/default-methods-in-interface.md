# Default Methods in Interface

Defender (default) methods in an interface are really similar to the implemented methods in an abstract class. However, there are several differences, for example since the default methods are in the interface, it has to be public, while the methods in an abstact class could be protected or private.

Basically this is only an backward support for the newly introduced lambda features in Java 8.
