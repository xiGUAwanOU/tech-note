# Use MongoJack

MongoJack is a Document to POJO mapper. It seems to be quite interesting among several other ODMs like [Morphia](https://github.com/mongodb/morphia), [Spring Data](http://projects.spring.io/spring-data/) and [Jongo](http://jongo.org).

To use the library, add the following dependency:

  ```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.mongojack</groupId>
    <artifactId>mongojack</artifactId>
    <version>2.6.1</version>
</dependency>
  ```
