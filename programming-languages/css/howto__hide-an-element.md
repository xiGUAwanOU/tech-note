# Hide an Element

There are at least 3 ways to hide an element: `display: none`, `visibility: hidden`, `opacity: 0`. The differences are listed below.

| Property             | occupies space | consumes clicks |
|----------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| `opacity: 0`         |      YES       |       YES       |
| `visibility: hidden` |      YES       |       NO        |
| `display: none`      |      NO        |       NO        |

Notice that, none of them will prevent the loading of the content.
