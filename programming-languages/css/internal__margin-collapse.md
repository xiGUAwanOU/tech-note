# Margin Collapse
In the following 3 cases, the top/bottom margin of a block-level element will collapse.

* Adjacent siblings: the margins of adjacent siblings will collapse.
* Parent and first/last child: if there is no border, padding, or inline content to separate the margin-top of a block from the margin-top of its first child block; or no border, padding, inline content, height, min-height, or max-height to separate the margin-bottom of a block from the margin-bottom of its last child, then those margins collapse. The collapsed margin ends up outside the parent.
* Empty blocks: if there is no border, padding, inline content, height, or min-height to separate a block's margin-top from its margin-bottom, then its top and bottom margins collapse.
