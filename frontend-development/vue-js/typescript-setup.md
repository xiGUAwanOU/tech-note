# Typescript Setup

The original content here seems to be useless now, since the next version of `vue-cli` will officially support TypeScript. To use the future version of `vue-cli`, simply do:

```console
$ npm install -g @vue/cli
$ vue create project-name
```

And then follow the wizard.

Note that, in this way, the created project will NOT use webpack.

It is better to install the `@vue/cli-init` package afterwards:

```console
$ npm install -g @vue/cli-init
```
