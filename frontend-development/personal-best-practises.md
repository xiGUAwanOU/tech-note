# Personal Best Practises

## 1. Component & View

In some framework like Vue.js, the line between component and view is vague (this seems to have been changed since `vue-cli@3.0.0-beta.1`, the default project structure has different folders for components and views). However, to have a clean front-end project. I think the line between component and view should be clear. 

Intuitively speaking, a component should be a small and highly reusable piece of UI; a view should be a place where we could put components into and write logics to let them work together. However, these definitions cannot distinguish them effectively. Since a view could also be small and being reused in another place, and a component could also be made of other components.

## 2. Take Bad Network Conditions Into Account

Since there are more and more mobile devices browsering the website. It is very important to have an idea about how will the website look like if the network is slow. There is a network throttling function in the development tools in most of the browsers. Using that, we can get an roughly idea about how the webpage will be look like while the network is slow.
