## 1. Component & View

In some framework like Vue.js, the line between component and view is vague (this seems to have been changed since `vue-cli@3.0.0-beta.1`, the default project structure has different folders for components and views). However, to have a clean front-end project. I think the line between component and view should be clear. 

A component, by the definition of React.js, is an independent and reusable piece of UI. 

A view is a place where you can put your components into.
