# First Impression

Install CLI tool:

```shell
$ npm install -g ember-cli
```

Create a new project:

```shell
$ ember new <PROJECT_NAME>
```

It seems that the CLI tool `ember` is heavily involved in the development process. E.g. to start the server:

```shell
$ ember serve
```

Then use `http://localhost:4200/` to open the quick-start page.
