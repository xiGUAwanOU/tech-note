# Distinguish Between E2E Tests and Unit Tests

I personally always have problem distinguishing between e2e tests and unit tests. It seems that e2e tests could cover a part of unit tests, and unit tests could also cover a part of e2e tests. So the problem is, when should I write an e2e test and when should I write a unit test?
