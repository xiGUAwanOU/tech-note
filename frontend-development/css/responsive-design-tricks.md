# Responsive Design Tricks

## Responsive HTML
Make a webpage responsive. Put the following meta definition into the `<head>...</head>` selction:

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0">
```

This will overwrite the initial webpage width with the actual device width.

## Units
Currently trying to use `rem`, hope people with different default font size settings will see everything displayed correctly.
