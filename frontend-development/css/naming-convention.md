# Naming Convention

Personally I think BEM is a good start point. However the real situations are always more complex than the convention. Here I'm trying to figure out a naming convention for myself.

## BEM (Block, Element, Modifier)

Following definitions are extracted from the official BEM introduction:

* __Block__: Standalone entity that is meaningful on its own.
* __Element__: A part of a block that has no standalone meaning and is semantically tied to its block.
* __Modifier__: A flag on a block or element. Use them to change appearance or behavior.
