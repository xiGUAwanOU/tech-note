# Performance Problems

Sometimes, the structure of the source code has a big influence of performance. However, before the program has run with a large input data, the performance problems would probably remain implicit.

The problem is, once the structure of the source code is set, the overheads of the optimization is also there. To minimize the overheads of the optimization, one should think over the potential performance problems as soon as possible. This requires many experiences (to know what a performace problem would be and how one could solve it), and if necessary, a quick prototype for performance benchmarking would help.
