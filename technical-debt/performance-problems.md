# Performance Problems

Sometimes, the structure of the source code has a big influence on the performance. However, before the program has run with a large input data, the performance problems usually remain implicit.

The problem is, once the structure of the source code is set, the overheads of the optimization is also there, since the optimization may require a (partly) new structure of the source code. To minimize the overheads of the optimization, one should think over the potential performance problems as soon as possible, and do not concentrate too much on the structure itself (so that it is logically clear, and one may have happy coding time), but the relationship between the structure and restrictions (not only technical facts like performance, but also other facts like time schedule, budget, human resource, etc.). This requires many experiences (to know what a performace problem would be and how one could solve it), and if necessary, a quick prototype for performance benchmarking would help.
